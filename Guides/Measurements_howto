Input offset voltage--> Configure opamp as an inverting amplifier, apply zero input voltage and
			measure the output.

Input offset drift-->   Measure V_os at different temperatures then calculate the gradient.

PSRR--> 

Input bias current-->	Attach a high value resistor(100k to 1G ohm) in series with the input to the opamp, measure
			the voltage drop across the resistor and calculate the current.

Input offset current-->	Calculate the difference between the I_B currents at the non-inverting (+) and the the
			inverting (-) terminals. I_OS = I_B+ - I_B-.

Input voltage noise-->	Short the input to ground and measure the noise at the ouput then divide by the ASIC gain.

Input current noise-->	Short the input to ground and monitor the ouput with a spectrum analyzer.

Common-mode voltage range-->	The range of voltages within which the ASIC behaves linearly.

CMRR-->	

Differential input C-->	Use a network analyzer to measure the frequency response of the setup without the ASIC then
			again with the ASIC. Identify the corner frequencies (the frequencies where the signal
			amplitude drops by 3dB). Calculate the parasitic capacitance of the test setup, then use all
			to calculate the ASIC's input capacitance.
			
			For it to be differential, the measurements have to be done between the two input pins of
			the ASIC.

Common-mode input C-->	Use a network analyzer to measure the impedence and phase shift of the input pins while 
			applying a common mode voltage. Use the formula; Ccm = 1/(2 * pi * f *|z| * sin(theta)).

Open-loop voltage gain-->	Inject a small AC signal into the ASIC and measure the resulting output voltage.
				Ensure the output doesnt saturate since the open loop gain is usually very high.

Gain-bandwidth product-->	Same setup as open loop gain, this time sweep through frequencies and determine
				the opne loop gain at each frequency until the gain = 1 (0 dB).

Slew rate-->	Apply a square wave input and measure the time it takes for the output voltage to transition between
		specified voltage levels (e.g 10% to 90% of the output swing). The slew rate is then the voltage 
		difference divided by this time.
